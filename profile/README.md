## Future projects


### Blue stragglers model

Test the performance of ASteCA on clusters with bonafide BSS populations, after incorporating the BSS model from Xin et al. (2011)

### Binary systems probabilities

Analyze several clusters with the code that identifies binary systems and give
an estimate of the probability of binary fraction with mass, and the
distribution of q.

### GAIA1

Analysis of the GAIA1 cluster with Gaia EDR3 data.

### Eight (?) new Gaia clusters

Process the eight (include GAIA3 and GAIA8?) new clusters found in recent studies.

### Comparision between CMD distances

Compare several distribution distances to see which one better recovers the
true parameters of synthetic clusters.




## Doubtful

### Four NGC clusters

Analyze the IMF of the four clusters: NGC2571, NGC6242, NGC2660, NGC2509

### Five clusters

Analyze the five Clusters: HAF14, RUP41, RUP42, RUP44, RUP152.

### Clusters around TR24

Analysis of these four clusters located around Trumpler 24: NGC6242, Lynga13, NGC6192, Lynga14.

### Five embedded cluster

Analyze the five embedded clusters: DBS5, DBS60, DBS98, DBS116, DBS117.

### 13 frames used in my PhD

- [ ] Cross-match with Gaia DR2 (Bailer-Jones catalogue) to add parallax distances and (ra, dec) coordinates
- [ ] Add E_BV estimates with http://argonaut.skymaps.info/
- [ ] Use the [isochrones](https://isochrones.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package to assign z, log(age)
Article that applied the `isochrones` package [Bochanski et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....155..149B)
- [ ] The `StarHorse`, [Queiroz et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.476.2556Q/abstract) package estimates "*masses, ages, distances, and extinctions for field stars*".
- [ ] The method presented in [Green et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200616258G/abstract) also does what `StarHorse` does but empirically.
- [ ] [Stellar Parameter Determination from Photometry using Invertible Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08391), Ksoll et al. (2020). Might be useful
- [ ] The `brutus` package https://github.com/joshspeagle/brutus can be used to fit individual sources

### 4 GCs

Four large globular clusters with DECam data
